        The quizzes should be a signal to you about whether you're keeping up with the pace of the course.

      <title>Attendance Policy</title>

      <p>
        Attendance is expected and will be recorded.
        If you need to miss a class for some reason, it is your responsibility to get notes from another student for any material you've missed, and to arrange to turn in/make up any in-class or collected work.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>


    <paragraphs>
      <title>Attendance and Your Health</title>

      <p>
        To achieve course learning goals, students must attend and participate in classes, according to the course requirements.
        However, if you have tested positive for or are experiencing symptoms of a contagious illness, you should not come to campus or attend in-person  classes or activities.
        It is the student’s responsibility to contact me to create a plan for participation and engagement in the course as soon as you are able to do so, and to make a plan to complete all assignments in a timely fashion.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>


    <paragraphs>
      <title>Expectations for Class Conduct</title>

      <p>
        It is important to foster a respectful and productive learning environment that includes all students in our diverse community of learners.
        Our differences, some of which are outlined in the University's nondiscrimination statement, will add richness to this learning experience.
        Therefore, all opinions and experiences, no matter how different or controversial they may be perceived, must be respected in the tolerant spirit of academic discourse.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>


    <paragraphs>
      <title>Disability Statement</title>

      <p>
        Any student who has a need for accommodations based on the impact of a documented disability or medical condition should contact Disability Resources and Services (DRS) in Howard Gittis Student Center South, Rm 420 (<url href="mailto:drs@temple.edu">drs@temple.edu</url>; 215-204-1280) to request accommodations and learn more about the resources available to you.
        If you have a DRS accommodation letter to share with me, or you would like to discuss your accommodations, please contact me as soon as practical.
        I will work with you and with DRS to coordinate reasonable accommodations for all students with documented disabilities.
        All discussions related to your accommodations will be confidential.

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Academic Freedom</title>

      <p>
        Freedom to teach and freedom to learn are inseparable facets of academic freedom.
        The University has adopted a policy on Student and Faculty Academic Rights and Responsibilities (Policy # 03.70.02) which can be accessed <url href="https://secretary.temple.edu/policies">here</url>.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>


    <paragraphs>
      <title>Add/Drop Policy</title>

      <p>
        Students will be charged for a course unless dropped by the Drop/Add deadline date.
        Check the <url href="https://registrar.temple.edu/academic-calendar">University calendar</url> for exact dates.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the Drop/Add period, students may drop a course with no record of the class appearing on their transcript.
        Students are not financially responsible for any courses dropped during this period.
        In the following weeks prior to or on the withdrawal date students may withdraw from a course with the grade of "W" appearing on their transcript.
        After the withdrawal date students may not withdraw from courses.
        Check the <url href="https://registrar.temple.edu/academic-calendar">University calendar</url> for exact dates.

    </paragraphs>


    <paragraphs>
      <title>AI Policy</title>

      <p>
        The use of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, etc.) is not permitted in this class unless specifically announced for a particular assignment; therefore, any use of AI tools for work in this class may be considered a violation of Temple University's Academic Honesty policy and Student Conduct Code, since the work is not your own.
        The use of unauthorized AI tools will result in a grade of zero on the assignment; a second offense will be reported to the Student Conduct Board.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>


    <paragraphs>
      <title>Incomplete Grades</title>

      <p>
        The grade "I" (an "incomplete") is only given if students cannot complete the course work due to circumstances beyond their control.
        It is necessary for the student to have completed the majority of the course work with a passing average and to sign an incomplete contract which clearly states what is left for the student to do and the deadline by which the work must be completed.
        The incomplete contract must also include a default grade that will be used in case the "I" grade is not resolved by the agreed deadline.
