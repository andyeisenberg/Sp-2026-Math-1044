  <introduction>
    <p>
      This is an outline of the topics we covered in the first week of class.
      These notes are <em>not</em> a substitute for your own note-taking.
      I highly recommend that you take your own notes during class.
      If you ever miss a class for any reason, reach out to another student in class to get a copy of their notes.

    <p>
      In calculus, you mostly asked <term>deterministic</term> questions about functions.
      In science experiments, you need to take <term>randomness</term> into account.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A toxin molecule in a cell has a certain chance each minute to leave the cell.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A patient takes a diagnostic test for a disease and wants to know the chance that they have the disease based on the test result.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Based on historical year-over-year population growth rate data for a particular species, what is a reasonable range for next year's population?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>sample space</term>, often denoted <m>\Omega</m>, is the set of all possible results of an experiment.
          A single result is called an <term>outcome</term>, while a collection of results is called an <term>event</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition xml:id="def-subset">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a set.
          The symbol <m>\in</m> means "is an element of", as in <m>a \in A</m>.
          Given another set <m>B</m>, we say <m>A</m> is a <term>subset</term> of <m>B</m>, written <m>A\subset B</m>, to mean that every element of the set <m>A</m> is also an element of the set <m>B</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example xml:id="example-sample-space">
      <statement>
        <p>
          An experiment consists of rolling a standard 6-sided die.
          The sample space is <m>\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}</m>.
          One possible event is <m>A = \{2, 4, 6\}</m>, i.e., the event that the result of the roll is even.

    <definition xml:id="def-set-operations">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, each contained inside <m>\Omega</m>.
          We can combine sets in a variety of ways: <dl>
          <li>
            <title>Union</title>

            <p>
              The <term>union</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is the set <m>A \cup B = \{x \mid x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>Intersection</title>

            <p>
              The <term>intersection</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is the set <m>A \cap B = \{x \mid x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>Difference</title>

            <p>
              The <term>set difference</term> <m>A-B</m> is the set <m>A - B = \{x \mid x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B\}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>Complement</title>

            <p>
              The <term>complement</term> of <m>A</m> is the set <m>A^c = \{x \in \Omega \mid x \notin A\}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <title>Empty Set</title>

            <p>
              The <term>empty set</term>, usually written <m>\emptyset</m> or <m>\{\}</m>, is the set which contains no elements.

      It's useful sometimes to draw pictures called <term>Venn diagrams</term> representing sets:

      Next, we want to start assigning probabilities to each individual outcome so we can then find the probabilities of events.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An experiment consists of rolling a standard 6-sided die.
          The sample space is <m>\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}</m>.
          We might assign probabilities as follows:
        </p>

        <table>
          <title>Distribution for a fair die</title>

          <tabular halign="center">
            <row bottom="minor">
              <cell><m>x</m></cell>
              <cell><m>\Pr(x)</m></cell>

        <p>
          Note that we don't have to assign the same probability to each outcome.
          If we do, we call this distribution <term>uniform</term>.
          If we have some event, such as <m>A = \{2, 4, 6\}</m>, then we calculate the probability of the event by adding together the probabilities of the outcomes that make up the event:
          <md>
            <mrow> \Pr(A) = \Pr(2) + \Pr(4) + \Pr(6) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} </mrow>
          </md>
          Note that this is the same result that we would get if we counted the total number of outcomes in <m>A</m> and divided by the total number of outcomes in <m>\Omega</m>.

      </statement>
    </example>

    <definition xml:id="def-cardinality">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given a finite set <m>A</m>, the <term>cardinality</term> of <m>A</m>, written <m>|A|</m>, is the number of elements in <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <fact>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\Omega</m> is a finite probability space with the uniform distribution and <m>A \subset \Omega</m> is an event, then:
          <md>
            <mrow> \Pr(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|} </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </fact>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we have a weighted die that's much more likely to come up 6 than any other outcome.
