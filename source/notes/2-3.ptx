    <p>
      This is an outline of the topics we covered in class.
      These notes are <em>not</em> a substitute for your own note-taking.
      I highly recommend that you take your own notes during class.
      If you ever miss a class for any reason, reach out to another student in class to get a copy of their notes.

    <title>Variance</title>

    <p>
      Question: How spread out are <m>X</m> values? One answer we might try is to measure the average distance from the average value:
      <md>
        <mrow> \E\left[|X - \E(X)|\right] </mrow>
      </md>
      To simplify notation, we'll write <m>\mu = \E(X)</m>.
      Also, it's often usefull to square a term rather than take absolute value when we want to ensure a positive output, so we'll define...

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>X</m> be a random variable with <m>\E(X) = \mu</m>.
          The <term>variance</term> of <m>X</m> is:
          <md>
            <mrow> \sigma^2 = \Var(x) = \E\left[ (X - \mu)^2\right] </mrow>
          </md>
          <m>\sigma = \sqrt{\Var(X)}</m> is called the <term>standard deviation</term>.
