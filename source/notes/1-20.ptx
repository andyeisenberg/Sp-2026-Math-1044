  <introduction>
    <p>
      This is an outline of the topics we covered in class.
      These notes are <em>not</em> a substitute for your own note-taking.
      I highly recommend that you take your own notes during class.
      If you ever miss a class for any reason, reach out to another student in class to get a copy of their notes.

    <definition xml:id="def-RV">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>random variable</term> is a function <m>X \colon \Omega \to \R</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      The idea is that <m>X</m>   is a variable representing a real number value which depends on the outcome of an experiment.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An experiment consists of planting 50 seeds in a garden, then growing them for 3 months.
          Let <m>H_i</m> be the height of plant <m>i</m>.
