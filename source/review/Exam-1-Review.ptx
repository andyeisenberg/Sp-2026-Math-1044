    <title>Allowed Materials</title>

    <p>
      You will be allowed to use a scientific calculator (<em>not</em> a graphing calculator, <em>not</em> a calculator app on your phone).
      You may not share a calculator with another student; you must use your own calculator.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may bring a standard 3 in x 5 in index card with prepared notes.
      You may use both sides of the notecard.
      You must put your full name in the top right corner of the card, and turn it in along with your exam.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Consider the sets <m>A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}</m>, <m>B = \{2, 4, 9, 10, 12, 14, 19\}</m>, and <m>C = \{9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 20\}</m>, which are all subsets of <m>\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, \dotsc, 20\}</m>.
      </p>
    </introduction>


    <task>

        <p>
          Find <m>A - (B \cap C)</m>.

          <m>\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}</m>
        </p>
      </answer>

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find <m>|A|</m>, <m>|B|</m>, <m>|C|</m>, <m>|A\cup B|</m>, <m>|A \cap B|</m>, <m>|B\cap C|</m>, <m>|A\cap C|</m>, and <m>|A\cup B\cup C|</m>.
          Is it true that the size of the union of sets is equal to the sum of the sizes of the individual sets?
        </p>
      </statement>

      <answer>
        <p>
          <m>|A| = 10</m>, <m>|B| = 7</m>, <m>|C| = 7</m>, <m>|A \cup B| = 13</m>, <m>|A \cap B| = 4</m>, <m>|B\cap C| = 3</m>, <m>|A\cap C| = 2</m>, <m>|A\cup B\cup C| = 17</m>. In particular, note that <m>|A\cup B| = 13 \neq 10 + 7 = |A| + |B|</m>, so it is not true in general that the size of the union of sets is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets.

        Suppose we have a 6-sided die that's weighted to roll a 6 half of the time.
        We roll the die two times.
        List the set of all possible results.
        [Note: the result (2, 4)---rolling a 2 and then a 4---is different from the result <m>(4, 2)</m>---rolling a 4 and then a 2.]

        Note that <m>\Omega</m> simply lists outcomes with no reference to the probabilities.
        So the answer here is the same as in <xref ref="example-sample-space"/>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose we flip a coin two times.
        List the set of all possible results.
        What about flipping three times? Four times? If we flip the coin 10 times, how many possible results will there be?
      </p>
    </statement>

    <answer>
      <p>
        For two flips: <m>\Omega = \{ HH, HT, TH, TT \}</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For three flips: <m>\Omega = \{ HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT \}</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For four flips:
        <md>
          <mrow> \Omega = \{ \amp HHHH, HHHT, HHTH, HTHH, </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp THHH, HHTT, HTHT, HTTH, </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp THHT, THTH, TTHH, HTTT, </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp THTT, TTHT, TTTH, TTTT \}. </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        Each additional flip doubles the number of outcomes.
        So, with ten flips, we'll have <m>|\Omega| = 2^{10} = 1024</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        If we roll a 6-sided die ten times, how many possible results will there be?
      </p>
    </statement>

    <answer>
      <p>
        Each additional roll will multiply the number of outcomes by 6.
        So, with 10 rolls, we'll have <m>|\Omega| = 6^{10}.</m>

        Suppose a die has the values <m>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6</m> on the faces, but the die is not fair.
        Instead, the probabilities scale by the same amount as the face values.
        For example, a result of 4 is twice as likely as a result of 2, since 4 is twice as large as 2; a result of 6 is six times more likely than a result of 1; and so on.
        Write a probability distribution table for this die.

        A toxin molecule inside a cell has a 0.3 probability of leaving the cell during a 1-minute period.
        For each value of <m>n = 1, 2, 3, \dotsc</m>, find the probability of the toxin molecule leaving the cell during the <m>n</m>th minute.

        For short, write <m>\Pr(n)</m> to mean the probability of the toxin molecule leaving during the <m>n</m>th minute.

        A diagnostic test is developed to detect a disease present in 3.2% of the population.
        For a patient who has the disease, the test will accurately give a positive result 65% of the time.
